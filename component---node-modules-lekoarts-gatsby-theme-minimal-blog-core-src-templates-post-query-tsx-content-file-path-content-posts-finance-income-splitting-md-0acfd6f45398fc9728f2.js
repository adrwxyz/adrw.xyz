The gains on sale of her investments are taxed at a much lower tax rate than if those gains had been attributed to her husband. Plus, those gains are further reduced since the interest she pays on the HELOC is tax deductible because she uses the loan for investments. Since the house is a joint asset but the margin account is strictly the wife's, this pattern provides a path for asset transfer from the husband to wife without the limits of the traditional joint account tax attribution which sets taxation based on funds contributed and would thus lead to any gains being counted against the husband assuming most of the funding of the margin account was from him."),"\n",a.createElement(t.p,null,"Over time, the wife can sell investments and be taxed minimally on capital gains or hold income bearing investments and similarly be taxed minimally on earned dividends or interest; all of such income which would otherwise have been attributed to the husband and taxed at his top marginal tax bracket (which could be over 50% depending on the province)."),"\n",a.createElement(t.p,null,"Now, consider the case of the first year where the wife has just retired and that they already had an existing joint margin investment account that had a large amount of investments with unrealized gains.

Consider the case where the husband in all the prior years used his income to cover all household expenses and let his wife contribute 100% of her after tax income into the joint margin account. There then is a large amount of the margin account gains that could be attributed strictly to her based on that contribution path. To segregate any future gains under her lower taxed income, she can sell the amount of joint margin funds that resulted from her 100% post-tax income contribution from the previous years, pay down the mortgage principle, draw on HELOC, and then re-invest in her sole margin account to remove any ambiguity around who is taxed for investment gains on those funds. The husband can slowly each year sell a portion of the funds and follow the similar path to space out the gains that would be higher taxed across a few years while still gradually moving them all to his wife's HELOC funded margin account."))}var o=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},(0,i.RP)(),e.components);return t?a.createElement(t,e,a.createElement(r,e)):r(e)},s=n(1173);function l(e){return a.createElement(s.A,e,a.createElement(o,e))}s.A},7715:function(e,t,n){var a=n(557),i=n(6540),r=n(4194),o=n(3601),s=n(2174);t.A=e=>{let{tags:t}=e;const{tagsPath:n,basePath:l}=(0,o.A)();return(0,a.Y)(i.Fragment,null,t.map(((e,t)=>(0,a.Y)(i.Fragment,{key:e.slug},!!t&&", ",(0,a.Y)(r.Link,{sx:e=>{var t;return{...null===(t=e.styles)||void 0===t?void 0:t.a}},to:(0,s.A)("/"+l+"/"+n+"/"+e.slug)},e.name)))))}}}]);

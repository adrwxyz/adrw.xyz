Since his coming to prominence in 2015 and 2016, I've listend to likely north of 100 hours of Jordan Peterson's lectures and podcasts.

Yet in the past year, I have not been listening to much of his podcast or works. A conversation with my wife that pierced through years of suppressed emotions and experiences reminded me that there was still much of my room I had left to clean up.

The book does a good job of formalizing and providing some limited communication structure to many of Peterson's core principles. His rambling, oft diving down rabbit holes of explanations on Russian gulags or Biblical Genesis story weaving of narrative, philosophy, psychology, and principles to live by will certainly remind you of his lectures but as if they had been edited and cleaned up a bit. I found this to be beneficial and easier listening.

Especially for the time in my life, the book was an important reminder in the importance of setting boundaries and not ignoring my own psyche, life experiences, and emotions. I'd recommend it with an open mind to the potential wisdom that a passionate University of Toronto professor with rural Albertan roots and a passion for finding the meaning of life has to offer in 12 rules for living.

# Sushi Ondo

Nathan, owner of restaurant for 5 years. Restaurant opened 3 weeks ago
Jason, sushi chef of over 25 years

When you walk in and experience the clean interior design, warm hospitality, and top quality Japanese cuisine, it might be hard to believe that Sushi Ondo is only 3 weeks old. Owner, Nathan, and head sushi chef, Jason, have brought extensive experience (5 and 25+ years respectively) in restaurant management and sushi preparation to a new location. Excellent quality salmon and tuna hand rolls, mouth watering shrimp and avocado salad, at fair prices, you won’t go wrong here. Restaurant was quite full even on a Monday night so book ahead if you want anything other than the sushi bar. Highly recommended. Note: disregard the pork burger sign outside, it will be taken down soon according to the owner.

# Cala

Up scale Mexican restaurant with excellent cocktails and authentic, small plate, inspired cuisine. Orlando at the bar was a master at his craft.

Peliroja cocktail (verde mezcal, cynar, Ginger, fresh citrus) was a perfect pairing with my two dishes.

Trout tastadas with chipotle, avocado, and fried leeks: sashimi style trout on a crispy 2 inch round tortilla with moderately spicey pickled habanero salsa on the side. Fresh light taste, habanero brings out the full palette.

Sopes with smoked lingcod and pickled onion: thicker doughy corn flour rounds with Smokey cod and red onions to top. An extra plate of the habanero salsa helped too.

A bit pricey but probably to be expected.

**Most resumes look the same. Name, contact, education, work experience, interests. Without a deliberate effort to tie all of the sections together, your resume ends up reading more like a restaurant menu.**

## Q: My resume is a list of jobs and side-projects, how do I fix this?

Ever found that your resume or LinkedIn profile starts to feel like a bland list of cool stuff you've done but doesn't get you interviews?

Earlier in the series, we've gone through the techniques ([1](/blog/hired-part-1)and [2](/blog/hired-part-2)) that will get your resume past hiring software into the hands of managers.

_Software doesn't care_ about focus or narrative so your list-of-cool-stuff-resume may do great on software search rankings but still not get you any interviews.

**You may have the resume keywords that impress software, but how do you impress hiring managers?**

> It's time to discover the power of the thesis.

## Q: A thesis? That sounds familiar. Something, something... high school English?

A thesis is a **structured argument**. The central argument is _declared_, split into _evidence categories_, supported by specific _proof_, and reiterated frequently.

Though many of us will have learned this in the context of academic writing in high school English class, a thesis is radically applicable in so many other applications.

This post has been on my mind for over a year precisely because it is such a _major key to great resumes, interview, and pitches_.

> Don't believe me? Keep reading...

## Q: Why do I need a thesis?

Your resume is an argument for why you deserve an interview. A thesis structure is often the **the difference between a good resume and a persuasive resume**.

I've even had success thanks to using this structure in interviews, written applications, short pitches, and competition presentations.

> So yeah, a thesis works in more than just essays on the soliloquies of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

## Q: Refresh my memory, how does a thesis work?

My high school English teacher, Mr. Blake, drilled into our heads how to structure a thesis. So here are his 5 steps using the example of proving that Scooby Doo is a dog.

1. **Declare** a strong, concrete argument (_Scooby is a dog_)
2. **Categorize** evidence into 2-5 groups (_Scooby is a dog and this is evident by his veterinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking_)
3. **Support** categories with specific proof (_Scooby's veterinary certificate states that he is a Great Dane dog_)
4. **Generalize** the proof (_A veterinary certificate is a trusted document that is frequently used to certify animal breeds_)
5. **Reiterate the declaration** in the conclusion (_Thus, Scooby's veterinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking is evidence that Scooby is a dog_)

**D.C.S.G.R.** is not a particularly memorable acronym, but this thesis structure is how humans have successfully persuaded each other for thousands of years. Stories and arguments are how we reason with ourself and successfully communicate with others.

> Even cavemen had to persuade a group where to hunt next.

## Q: Alright, so where's the formal _declaration, evidence categories, and proof_ on your resume?

**It's all hiding in plain sight.** My resume still looks like anything you'd find on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=resume).

The difference is that mine reads with **a persuasive, laser-focused message**.

Hiring managers aren't looking for a _declaration_ section, but they will be better persuaded when your resume has one baked in.

So here's my resume highlighted with the different areas of my thesis.

- Red: **Declaration**
- Orange: **Evidence categories**
- Green: **Supporting proof**

## Where is the _generalized proof_ and _reiterated declaration_ on your resume?

Most of the _generalization_ happens implicitly as someone is reading the resume given it is a less formal document and inferences are made intuitively.

As a manager scans through the resume, their eyes will naturally keep coming back to the bold, large-font _declaration_, effectively reiterating it without advertising-like repetition of a large headline on the page.

## Q: How do I build my own declaration, evidence categories and proof?

## Declaration

Ever been told your resume should start with an objective? Usually this ends up sounding pretty bland and simply regurgitates the job posting description.

_Objective: seeking intern position on a marketing team in the consumer packaged goods industry_

A thesis _declaration_ gives you the opportunity to state your case:

- what position you want
- why you're qualified for it
- how you'll be a better candidate than anybody else

**Make your declaration stand out.** Use bold or large font to treat it as a headline, or feature it in an About section. Put it at the beginning and make it noticeable so it can frame your resume deliberately in the minds of the reader.

![Say hello to my declaration in red.](../images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-thesisc.png)

In my _declaration_ I cover the following key areas:

- My name: _Andrew Paradi_
- The position I seek: _intern_ (likely should be more specifically "dev intern")
- The desired hiring period: _summer '16_
- My competence: _ready_
- The type of work I'm interested in: _tackle ambitious projects_

> Every person's declaration will have a different formula, so start with a base, then tweak, cut, and add until it's your own.

## Evidence categories

Consider 2-6 specific _evidence categories_ that can prove the competence and credibility of your _declaration_.

Given my _declaration_ stating that I'm **ready to tackle ambitious projects**, my _evidence categories_ are focused on proving both that I'm **ready** and that I have experience tackling **ambitious projects**. Here are my current ones:

- History of success in startups, competitions, and academic
- Strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition
- Takes initiative
- Thrives under pressure
- Learns quickly
- Entrepreneur

## Supporting Proof

When writing your resume, keep your _declaration_ and _categories of evidence_ in mind at all times.

Any experience, skills, or jobs you write about should be easily _categorized_ and, transitively, prove your _declaration_.

Consider these examples of _proof_ and their related _evidence categories (EC)_:

![EC: History of success in startups. Strong coding skills. Takes initiative. Learns quickly.](../images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof1c.png)

![EC: History of success in startups, competitions. Strong communication skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure. Entrepreneur.](../images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof2c.png)

![EC: History of success in competition. Strong coding & communincation skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure.](../images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof3c.png)

![EC: Takes iniative. Thrives under pressure. Learns quickly.](../images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof4c.png)

**Note:** Seriously reconsider any experience, skill, or job that can't be _easily categorized_ or doesn't directly prove your _declaration_. You should likely ditch it.

> Unrelated proof is clutter. It distracts from your declaration. It makes your thesis less persuasive.

## Q: Any other tips?

The **tone of your writing is important** in your _declaration_, _evidence category names_, and _proof_ (not to mention your cover letters and writing in general)!

_Passive tense makes you sound complacent... asleep at the wheel. Yawn._

As much as possible, I stick to **simple past tense** on resumes or **present tense** in general to communicate with a direct, concrete tone.

- **Passive** (learning, teaching, programming...)
- **Simple Past** (built, developed, tested...)
- **Present** (pitch, present, develop, build...)

## Eat the elephant one bite at a time

I know I hit you with a lot to think about. Restructuring your resume to be a persuasive thesis will take practice.

Now, I don't worry about getting my resume perfect on the first try ([or the 21st try]({{ site.resume }}))! **My resume is a fluid piece of art**, so I can keep making it iteratively better ([**just like Kanye**](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11243072/kanye-west-life-of-pablo-new-song-tidal-update)).

For example, I'm still considering my layout and the position of **Education &amp; Skills**.

- Is this the most persuasive first proof a hiring manager could encounter?
- Does the glance-able skills list prompt curiosity for my Github projects or seem like I'm blowing smoke?
- Is the density of information overwhelming and diminish their likelihood to read further?

These are just some of the questions I continue to think about in terms of my resume.

Test and see which _declaration_ resonates, what _evidence categories_ address hiring manager's questions, and which _proof_ most concisely persuades someone to accept your _declaration_.

> Soon your resume will be a refined thesis that persuades hiring managers to schedule you for interviews.

## <!-- Coming next in Blog :: Hired

Finding the right thesis can be tricky (I haven't found an _Optimizely for resumes_ yet or else I'd be using it!).

I use my _declaration_, _evidence categories_, and _proof_ in interviews &amp; when I network. I gauge people's reaction and tweak my message to find the phrases and stories that impress and spark curiosity.

> Next week, I'll explain how you can prepare for and use interviews &amp; networking to develop your winning thesis. -->

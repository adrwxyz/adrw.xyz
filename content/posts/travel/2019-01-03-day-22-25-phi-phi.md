This island once was a tropical paradise, it’s now the favoured destination for party seekers from Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. Music blares loud at all times from side by side bars and hotels.

The island without vehicles is navigated walking through winding streets where there are more signs for tattoo parlours and restaurants advertising pizza and French fries than ones offering Thai curries and local cuisine. This is a place for the washed up and the partying wanderlusters. In the evening, there is no peace or quiet to be found here.

In the morning, there is a calm amidst the hills separating the waters. And it was good.

> “And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.” – [Genesis‬ ‭1:9-10‬ ‭ESV‬‬](https://bible.com/59/gen.1.9-10.esv)

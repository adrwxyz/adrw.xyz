I learned a lot from my Dad. He travelled a lot and often dropped hints of how to enable _pro-mode_ when you travel.

Time changes with long flights can mess people up for days.

### For short trips, the key can be to stay on a single time zone.

Your body likes rhythms of sleeping, eating, and activity at the same time everyday. Dad would often stay on EST when he did short trips to the West Coast to keep from changing his rhythms. Iâ€™ve found that made things easier when Iâ€™ve done short trips to Sam Francisco.

### But what about longer trips?

Stay up all night and pre-adjust your watch a day before so youâ€™re ready when you land ðŸ˜‰

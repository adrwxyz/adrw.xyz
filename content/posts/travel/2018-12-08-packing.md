It's been a busy week! I finished final projects at work. We stayed up late planning the first two weeks of our trip (we had no plans at all as of Tuesday).

And in less than 36 hours, Suzie and I will be off on an adventure, the scale of which we've never attempted before: 4 weeks through 4 countries with 1 backpack each.

Check back here [travel.adrw.xyz](http://travel.adrw.xyz) for more updates on our adventure!

For now, I'll get back to packing...

Also, Christkindl Market was delicious!

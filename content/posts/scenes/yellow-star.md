# 2021-07-06 Yellow Star

"I'm sorry but for all of our safety, you will need to wear this."

The line is heard often by those who have not yet taken part. What they wear serves of no practical benefit in the medical or scientific realm. None that can be verified in any study.

And yet, it is treated as inarguable that the wearing is necessary to protect.. the protected. Or it is necessary for the unprotected to weart it to protect... themselves. I cannot discern logically how much sense can be made from these latest of slogans to live by.

No, there is no practical benefit lest that of hygenic akin to sneezing into a tissue or turning away to cough. Worn, it stops little if any of the harm flowing in or out. If the protected are protected, why must anyone else take on additional precautions?

The reason is thus: that those who have not partaken must be marked. Society must have a winnowing fork to discern who is with "the Logic" and who is against.

"The Logic" used to refer to ancient Greek mathematical theorems, proofs, and approaches to critical thinking. It wasn't a set of beliefs, but an approach to analysis, a set of rules to govern the debate and aim towards discerning the most likely truth on a given question.

But as of late, it simply refers to whatever the new government provided guidance is repeated on the breakfast news program, in the motivational music videos, in the monologues of late night talk shows, and in the daily papers. While the logic of old often rested on theorems not disproven for millenia, the new "Logic" can turn on a dime. Guidance can be reversed overnight without explanation or any effort of persuasion (in the old logic sense) for why a new course must be charted (and fortwith)!

At one point, I found a half-burned history book in the garbage heap that mentioned a Yellow Star once used to discern who was against society. The protected able to be warned against fraternizing with the enemies of the state who had such coloured shapes of felt afixed to their jackets, blouses, and school coats. I'm not sure what came of those enemies. I haven't run into anyone wearing a Yellow Star in my lifetime. The second half of the book wasn't legible so I'm not sure what came of them.

I got news of my grandmother's illness on a dreary Thursday evening. The message read that regrettably there was nothing to be done and she was being sent home to die.

I sought to see her face to face once more, having been prohibited for years by my mother who guarded my grandparents like a studious warden, not letting friend, foe, or family near lest they catch "it" and perish.

Well, Grandma didn't catch "it", but certainly will be dead soon. Though, if I'm being honest, she may has well died when the papers first ran the headlines of "it" emerging in United Eurasia. She hasn't lived in the years since.

Every holiday, every birthday, she and my Grandfather would plead to see us again; their grandchildren, their son, close friends. My mother never relented, pleading and crying with them to resist the temptation as she backed away slowly and locked them away. Not ones for conflict, they obliged. And us not ones for conflict, didn't fight my mother as she oft claimed the moral highground of protecting my grandparents.

And so, birthdays came and went, Spring Solstice, Winter Solstice, new moons come and gone, my mother often sending out copies of photographs of her visits with them celebrating this or that with a big smile on her face; smaller, fainter ones on my grandparents.
They longed for the empty seats at the table to be filled with family and friends once again.

What price should one pay for wrongly imprisoning someone for their final years. I read once that most prisons used to release dying or old prisoners to grant them some mercy before their death. My mother granted grandmother and grandfather no such luxury.

Their final years will have been lived alone, protected from love, immune from life. At least they didn't catch "it".

And now, my final visit has come. Told to wear it or else not come. My grandmother will not see the face of her grandson in person before she dies. Her weak face will scan mine to discern who I am, the familiar cheeks and mouth signposts she will no longer be able to follow to match her memories with who is in front of her.

I'm not sure how many have died for taking part, the latest "Logic" I read deemed death impossible after taking part, so the health ministry stopped counting.

Grandmother took part but will soon be dead from another illness. Protected from "it", she will have lived her final years alone, any coming near covered, her final years of life lived out like a petri dish in a longrunning experiment.

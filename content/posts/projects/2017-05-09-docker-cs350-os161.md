---

**The university CS servers were down, so I built a Docker image and build-test script to let me keep working.**

## [Check out the repo on GitHub.](https://github.com/adrw/docker-cs350-os161)

University of Waterloo's third year curriculum for Computer Science holds one of the more challenging courses of the program: **_CS350 Operating Systems_** (known by students as 'OS').

The OS course has students add core functionality to an existing operating system, Harvard's os161, written in C in 2000.

Given the bare bones nature of the OS, it has very specific build version requirements for GDB, G++, and Make that makes it very difficult to run locally on macOS.

With the school servers down at the beginning of the summer semester I was in a tight bind since I couldn't do my work for the first assignment. This led me to [@Uberi](https://github.com/Uberi)'s [uw-cs350-development-environment](https://github.com/Uberi/uw-cs350-development-environment) repo which inspired me to build my own local setup.

My [docker-cs350-os161](https://github.com/adrw/docker-cs350-os161) repo contains a lean Docker container built on Debian with all of the specific requirements to build os161. It is 24% smaller than any other images on Docker Hub.

I also built a comprehensive build script that includes many useful options and built in tests.

## build-and-run.sh options

- default: builds from source, runs side by side with GDB in Tmux
- `-b` - only build, don't run after
- `-c` - continuous build loop
- `-d` - set debug mode to output debug text
- `-m` - only run, with gdb tmux panels
- `-r` - only run, don't build, don't run with gdb
- `-t <opt>` - run test test alias
- `-l <opt>` - loop all following tests # times and log result in logs/ directory
- `-w` - clear all logs

It was a fun project to keep adding in functionality that let me be more productive as I worked through assignments.

If you're going into CS350 soon, good luck! Feel free to use or fork [my repo](https://github.com/adrw/docker-cs350-os161) to get started faster.

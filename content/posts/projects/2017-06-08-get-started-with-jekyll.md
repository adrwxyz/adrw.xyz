I've been using Jekyll on GitHub Pages for my website since 2015.

After a couple people have asked how they can try Jekyll, I created this guide!

Even if you don't have coding experience, I've tried to write [this guide](/get-started-with-jekyll/) so that it's approachable for everyone. Give it a try, and let me know how it can improve.

## [Go to the Guide](/get-started-with-jekyll/)

## Why Get-Started-with-Jekyll?

1. GitHub pages will host your Jekyll website for free with super-fast servers and CDNs (servers around the world).
2. Jekyll is a simple yet powerful framework that helps structure a basic HTML site for easy use as a Blog, Portfolio, or any website.
3. Jekyll on GitHub pages is **faster** than Wordpress, **cheaper** than Squarespace, and is more **professional** than Wix.
4. Learn the basics below to [buy a domain](https://www.namecheap.com/), setup your GitHub pages repo, and start building your Jekyll blog. [Go to the guide!](/get-started-with-jekyll/)

```
[Refrain]
 C      C7          F         C
Amazing Grace! (how sweet the sound)
                         G
That saved a wretch like me!
  C        C7        F      C
I once was lost, but now am found,
    Am         G     C
Was blind, but now I see.


[Verse 1]
      C          C7        F        C
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
                     G
And grace my fears relieved.
    C        C7       F      C
How precious did that grace appear,
    Am     G       C
The hour I first believed.


[Verse 2]
      C      C7       F          C
Through many dangers, toils and snares
                G
We have already come
       C         C7         F          C
'Twas grace hath brought us safe thus far
     Am        G       C
And grace will lead us home


[Verse 3]
     C          C7        F        C
When we've been there ten thousand years,
                      G
Bright shining as the sun,
      C       C7      F          C
We've no less days to sing God's praise
     Am      G       C
Than when we first begun.


[Refrain]
 C      C7          F         C
Amazing Grace! (how sweet the sound)
                         G
That saved a wretch like me!
  C        C7        F      C
I once was lost, but now am found,
    Am         G     C
Was blind, but now I see.

# Typescript Blog

## Part 1

**I learned a lot moving a new project at Square to Typescript. Here's Part 1: A Typescript Primer.**

## Definition

Typescript is an optional superset on top of Javascript that adds enforced static typing.

## Why?

- Your code is safer. Types are checked at compile time to prevent basic type errors from entering production code.
- Writing code is faster. IDEs like Visual Studio Code have great built in warnings as you write for incorrect types and more powerful autocompletion since types that are formally defined can be filled in as you write.
- Write code faster when IDEs can use static types across your entire repo to
- tap into Typescript's single source of truth type definitions to provide inline type completion, documentation, and enforcement while you type.
- Catch type errors as you write instead of at runtime. Typescript enabled IDEs can compile as you write and warn of incorrectly formed types or autocomplete the correct type interface for what you're writing.

## Why not?

- There is more upfront work for developers. This includes formally defining static types and determining repo wide strategy for where and how types are defined.
- NPM interdependence can lead to headaches with packages that aren't written with Typescript or don't have typings.
- Additional compilation step
- Intelligent auto-complete and documentation with Typescript compatible IDEs. Formal types throughout an entire repo allow for your IDE of choice to auto-complete and enforce types as you write code. Relevant typed definitions also can be quickly presented because Typescript enforces a single source of truth for each class, function, and type.

- Part 1: What is Typescript

  - Definition
  - Benefits
  - Cons
  - How are types enforced?
  - How to declare types?
    - Inline variable/function parameter annotations
    - Typings files
  - Mitigating non-native TS packages

- Part 2: So you want to move your repo to Typescript
  - What is TS? Link back to part 1
  - General assumptions of a modern JS repo: Babel, Webpack, NPM packages, ES6/7 code
  - Preparing your build tools:
    - Necessary TS NPM packages
    - Updating Webpack config
  - Migrating your first JS file
    - Rename to `.ts` or `.tsx` respectively
    - Solve basic inline TS compiler errors
      - Most will be annotating your code with function parameter and variable formal types
      - Not everything is simply adding `: string` or `: number` as inline annotations to `.ts` code files, but this does solve a lot of them.
    - The fun types
      - Outside of inline annotations, Types can live in a few places and be of a few formats in Typescript.
      - Especially in React or with server endpoints, passing of complex objects into function parameters will require defining those objects. This can be done through declaring `interface`, `type`, or `class`.
      - If it is an object you produce and consume file-locally then using `declare type` will suffice
      - For package-local types, types should only be defined in a single location
    - This may lead to a dark place

Mind dump

- What is it
  - Superset of JS that adds types. Uses new JS compiler to enforce
- Why do we use it
  - Some studies show that 15% of production code errors have been because of type errors. TS prevents these and promotes a more rigorous code writing process
- What makes it different than JS (basic syntax)
  - All variables, class definitions, and function parameters now must have declared types (particularly if the "noImplicitAnys" compiler flag is on)
  - In practice, certainly a more conscious understanding of what types are used where
  - Compiler integration with VS Code and other IDEs much more powerful because they can provide intelligent auto-complete given the more detailed typings information
  - Issues: TS requires typings for packages that you use, not all are written in TS or have typings
  - Multiple ways to define types
    - Inline within `.ts` and `.tsx` files using `var name : type` syntax
    - Locally with local `type`, `interface`, or `class` definitions
    - Types can can also be defined in specific declaration files `filename.d.ts` which only include type definitions consumed by `filename.ts`.
- Moving an existing project to TS
  - Rename files to .ts and .jsx -> .tsx, now TS compiler will pick them up if your Webpack is properly setup
  - Perfectly valid .js code will often end up with 10+ errors, many are just adding types to function parameters and variables to satisfy "noImplicitAny"
- Dealing with external packages that are causing TS errors
  - See if it has a community provided library `@types/package` that provide the necessary typings
  - Check if updated version of package has the typings now added first-party
  - Use `include package = require('module');` instead of `import {} from ''` to override all TS checking
  - See if there is a similar package that can long term be transitioned to that uses TS more natively
- Lots still to learn
  - TS Compiler seems to sometimes need tweaking for which ECMAScript version code is being transpiled down to. For our purposes where cross-browser is not a priority, `es2017` is a possibility, others may need to still compile down to `es5` which is cross-compatible with most browsers including IE11.
  - Writing types in JS takes a bit of practice but becomes natural just as it is when writing Java or C code
  - Much easier to catch errors in consuming functions when parameters are formerly defined as a certain type. Complex types can be also be defined as interfaaces so that parameters like props into React Components

## Rules for Manhood
Taught to his son in 3rd grade.

1. Life is hard (boys want things to be easy, men embrace difficulty)
1. You are not important (boys only care about themselves, men care about others)
1. Your life is not about you (from the whole to the part, boys think they are the whole of the story, men know they are a part of the story)
1. You are not in control (from control to surrender, so much damage comes from men not acknowledging God in control and trying to control everything)
1. You are going to die (boys only think about now, men think about eternity â€“ destiny, legacy, fruit)

Highlighted men in history who did this well, content related, and challenges to emphasize the transition for each of these points.

C.S. Lewis says the goal of life is to move from focusing inward to focusing outwards on reality.

Process and Contrast. Stick with the process to improve (ie. gradual per belt improvement in tae kwan do) and then look back at the contrast of where you came from and where you now are.

Daily devotions with kids. 1 verse, 1 quote, 1 question.

One night per week was Man School, practical skills and acquisition. For each unit, there was a challenge/test to prove to themselves they had acquired the skill.

Confidence comes from competence. When you know how to do things, not when you've read about them, is when you feel confident to do things.

In every situation, have the kids participate. Go get more sauce at Chick-fil-a, ask a question at a Q&A. Help them level up to be comfortable in the adult world. Don't let school get in the way of your kid's education, make teaching your kids happen in the every day moments.

"I'm gonna make it", say that to yourself. Excitement, disillusionment, adjustment, health is the process for every new challenge. Don't be surprised when you hit challenges, say "I'm gonna make it".


## Stages of Formation
Common stages to formation in all cultures except the West of forming and initiating teens into the culture.

If as a man you haven't been through the full stages below, level up yourself.

- Separation: teens are taken from their childhood home into a new reality
- Initiated: they cross some sort of threshold and enter into a journey
- Formed: into the story of their community (not selfish), religion of their community (sense of reverence), and the gender roles their community requires of them to be helpful to their community
- The Ordeal: young person goes out on their own to prove if they've internalized and actualized all that they need to have learned. In some native cultures, it's being sent out for 6 months in the wilderness, or hunting a caribou on their own, or the Dutch have "dropping" leaving their teen in the woods by themselves and they need to find their way back.
- Reintegration: Upon succeeding at their ordeal, they are reintegrated into the community now as a full member

**Daryl Cooper**

Daryl Cooper, former US marine’s renowned podcast, Martyr Made, had a striking title for its earliest currently available series: Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem.

This 26 hour multipart deep dive into the origin of the state of Israel opened my eyes to a history of the Zionist project, tactics, and resulting suffering that I had until now been largely ignorant of given my mainstream media informed growing up and subsequent traditional right wing media sources.

That the founding of the state of Israel was a project of Europeans, not of local Jews, was the first of many profound new pieces of information that have drastically shifted my view on the state and ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Another were the accounts of decades of creative terrorism tactics and resulting carnage by feevent Zionists against the Arabs already living in the region, the British mandate colonial government (who largely supported the Zionists), and even less radical Jews.

Terrorism, as I’ve also learned in the Irish efforts for liberation from England, is not unique to any people or religion, despite popular recent narratives and memes otherwise.

For anyone who wants to be humbled in the face of the often untold history of the region and origins of current complexities, this podcast with its English, Hebrew, and Arab sources and many quotes from over 60 books is a good start.

**2018 | Jackie Hill Perry**

Jack Hill Perry caught my attention with her striking spoken word and Instagram posts that my wife had started following.

I was intrigued by her book title and have found it to be a thought provoking memoir on her experience with discovering her sexuality and finding her identity in Christ. The audiobook is read by her and feels like an intimate, rhythmic, personal story telling experience.

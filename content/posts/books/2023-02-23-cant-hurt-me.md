**2018 | David Goggins**

"Who's gonna carry the boat?!"

"Not today, son!"

Iconic self-talk like this and a life of absolute grit and mental fortitude made David Goggins stick in my memory.

His book shares his history of overcoming an extremely tough and broken childhood, a dead end malaise of his early 20s, and the near insurmountable challenges of Navy Seal, Army Ranger, and ultra marathon training, to develop a mindset of willing himself through some of the most tortuous conditions devised.

The book is a striking monument to the fact that what is standing between me and my potential is a lack of will, follow through, and choosing the pain required to succeed over a soft life of unfulfilled promise.

David also provided insight into the effects on a child of exposure to physical beating and domestic violence on their psyche and how they age into adulthood, many demons he was running from or wrestling with until well into his 40s.

This book ranks highly and I'd recommend it if you're looking to be pushed mentally towards a new perspective on what is possible for your life and what you're capable of.

**2015 | Paul Kalanithi**

Recommended by a friend who recently awoke again after their soul crushing sentence of 18 months in boutique investment banking, Kalanithi's book was a fitting one for my friend, and for me.

The reluctant neurosurgeon, initially drawn to the study of literature which had gripped him from early years of voracious reading, memorizing, and absorbing the classics; the author reflected and realized that to not take up the moral burden of medicine, of practical help to the sick and dying, would be an abdication of the mind, body, and legacy from his doctor father, with which he had been endowed.

Over a decade further of ruthless medical school, sugrical residency, and striving towards a presitigiuos career as neurosurgeon-neuroscientist, led to a pivotal moment of worsening fatigue and a painful cough as he flew back to New York to see friends, and his neglected wife (also a surgeon) declined to join him as she seeked space to reconsider marriage to a man of ambition.

On return after the trip, diagnosis pricked the delayed gratification asset bubble which had for years seen promises, hopes, and dreams deferred and compouned until that fabled sought after career was achieved.

Now, on the other side of the doctor-patient relationship, Kalanithi wrestled with how involved to be in his own treatment recommendations, how to trust another with his outcome. He struggled with how to choose what do with life.

> Grand illnesses are supposed to be life-clarifying. Instead, I knew I was going to die—but I’d known that before. My state of knowledge was the same, but my ability to make lunch plans had been shot to hell. The way forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left.

After some initial recovery, he set to get back to the operating room and complete his residency. He did while on increasing doses of medications to cope but soon the cancer relapsed and he resigned for good.

Having always thought to return to literature and write later in life after his medical career, Kalanithi turned his passionate efforts towards the writing of this book.

Their marriage renewed with the help of a life-threatening illness and marriage counselling, he and his wife wrestled with whether to fulfill their yearnings for parenthood, despite the dire likely outcome.

> I knew a child would bring joy to the whole family, and I couldn’t bear to picture Lucy husbandless and childless after I died, but I was adamant that the decision ultimately be hers: she would likely have to raise the child on her own, after all, and to care for both of us as my illness progressed.
> “Will having a newborn distract from the time we have together?” she asked. “Don’t you think saying goodbye to your child will make your death more painful?”.
> “Wouldn’t it be great if it did?” I said. Lucy and I both felt that life wasn’t about avoiding suffering.

Their baby was born and had tried her first solid food by the time the author died, surrounded by his loving wife, daughter, and family, 22 months after diagnosis.

In his final days, as his life had transitioned from grueling surgical schedule to a more present existence less aware of days let alone hours, he closed out his book with a message for his baby daughter.

> When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.

Kalanithi's book was a timely enjoiner to the importance of finding and living by your values with the indeterminate life we have left; to reflect, adjust course, seek wisdom, care passionately, bear your God-given yoke courageously, and live with grace.

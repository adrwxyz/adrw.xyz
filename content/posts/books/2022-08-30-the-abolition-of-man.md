**1943 | C.S. Lewis**

Inspired to re-read it after it was woven into many tracks on the 2021 album TAO (The Aboltion Of) by Shad, C.S. Lewis does not disappoint.

From a starting place of criticizing a new grade school English literature textbook, Lewis embarks on a journey of taking the common philosophies of the age to their natural end.

For example, the frequent Marxist deconstructing of all objective values leads not to some revelation of even more fudamental values, but instead removes the bedrock framework for a life of meaning itself.

If all art is but in the eye of the beholder, then that implies no existence of objective beauty, objective truth, a way of being that transcends culture and time and is as fundamental to the universe as the modernly venerated chemistry, physics, and biology.

Lewis doesn't exclusively make this argument from a Christian lens, instead drawing into his concept of the TAO the common threads found in religions and philosophies around the world and throughout time including Christianity, Judaism, Taoism, and others. From them arise the observance according to Lewis of a "natural law" which shows up across cultures to define the state of being for maximal human flourishing.

While the modern philosophies lead to continual disregard and devaluing of human values of loyalty, courage, purity, self-control, and others, the end result isn't a freeing of humans to maximize their freedom, but instead their iterative descent into becoming humans no longer, slaves to their feelings and desires, more like animal and subject to nature than the proposed modern goal of conquering nature.

The end result once all values found in the TAO are set aside, is a human devoid of any supersceding layer of thought or being or reasoning above what can maximally fulfill current material and emotional desires.

The relevancy of Lewis' critique to the current age is striking as the trends have continued, even hastened, towards the predicted desolation. Even in discussions with friends, they notably have little way to justify the protection of human life, the value of the opposite sex, the noble values of the TAO, or existence of objective truth.

In fact, not only can they not justify any of these long held now decaying cross-civilizational beliefs, many are turning themselves against them and decaying into the valueless, aimless, desire driven creatures Lewis warns of.

To persue the higher virtues while most set them aside as antiquated, mystical, irrelevant, unproductive, or illogical, will prove to be a defining battle of the age for every human who seeks not their own abolishment.

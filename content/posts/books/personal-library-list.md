Some books have earned a place on my personal library bookshelf because of their impact on my personal development, and hopefully their future impact on friends, family, eventual children who may borrow and read it.

I keep this up to date when I acquire or are gifted books off the list so anything still not checked off would be a much appreciated addition to the collection!

- [x] Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, Ray Dalio
- [ ] Pricinples for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail, Ray Dalio
- [ ] The Intentional Father, Jon Tyson

**2007 | Nassim Nicholas Taleb**

Written with the flourish of wit, or to some hubris, Taleb in this bestseller tears down traditionally sense-making-bodies failure to understand phenomenon by examining their tail end performance amidst highly improbably circumstances, not the more predictable bell curve performance under "normal" conditions.

The failure case, he argues, is what more precisely brings into focus the essence of the phenomenon; not the constant state pattern which won't capture the true vulnerabilities.

Taleb concisely draws on many behavioral economics and psychology concepts for why humans fall for such inaccurate pattern matching such as those that ended up composing "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. He brings up many examples of humans natural predilection to look for causation relationships and coming up with post hoc explanations to describe random phenomenon.

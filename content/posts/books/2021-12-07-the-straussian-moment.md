Peter Thiel's [essay](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs542%2Fsh%2F46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2%2F7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay%29Thiel) and [recent interview](https://youtu.be/iRleB034EC8) cover an interesting analysis of the current moment and how it extends from history.

For example, the religious wars of the 1600s following the Reformation and schism of the Protestant church from Roman Catholicism ended in the Peace of Westfalia, a truce whereby the peace was achieved by agreeing to let countries and individuals to determine their views on the big questions of life, meaning, God, faith, on their own, and not to be hashed out in the public square.

The subsequent admired Renaissance period where science, exploration, technology and the modern Western culture sprung up, Thiel posits, may have been more fundamentally a weaker intellectual ethic whereby people agreed that for the peace of society, they would not assume themselves capable enough to ask or answer the big questions of life.

This culture of fleeing from hard questions has continued to evolve through to the current age where the West continues to not seek out answers for those questions, content with the distraction of culture, media, and technology.

With one lens, one could view 2001 as when this peace of the unanswered questions ended. The involvement of religious extremists, who clearly are focused on the big questions of life, and their 20 year long victory one paper cut at a time against the American hegemony, points to a hollow and insufficient Western culture.

Drawing on the philosopher Strauss and Renee Girard (through his Scapegoat formulation), Thiel points to the potential that violence and the lack thereof has tradeoffs as it relates to resolving the big questions of life and politics.

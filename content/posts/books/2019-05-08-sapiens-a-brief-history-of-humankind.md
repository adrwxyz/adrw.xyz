**2015 | Yuval Noah Harari**

Sapiens sets out to describe the trajectory from beginning until now of our species. Though it does have interwoven much of the author's own opinion, presented as history, it does succeed at capturing the current secular understanding of the evolution of Homo Sapiens, the inflection points of the cognitive, agricultural, and industrial revolutions, and how shared myth has allowed for humans to cooperate and build together the complex human societies filled with politics, religion, and technology, that we have today.

**2016 | Dr. Jason Fung**

Dr. Jason Fung outlines in this book his findings from many years of research and in his medical practice assisting patients struggling with obesity and diabetes.

His findings are profound and cut against the past 50-100 years of poorly extrapoloated or propagandized research and government policy that has contributed to, and not helped, the obesity epidemic.

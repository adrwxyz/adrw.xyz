**2003 | Kevin Leman**

This book can be a mild chuckle inducing introduction to the topic for those who haven't dipped their toes in the genre; or for others it can be a hard to get through overview littered with goofy jokes and some seeming contradictions.

I found myself more in the first camp, my wife in the second; though I certainly agree with the criticism and would recommend an attitude to this book of coming with an open mind but still "chewing the meat and spitting out the bones" (as I recommend with most books).

The book primarily was first person accounts from Dr Leman, with some stories retold from his wife or clients. The lack of direct quotes at times reduced the credibility of the conveyed story, especially in comparison to the plethora of real story quotes in ["The Good Girl's Guide to Great Sex: (And You Thought Bad Girls Have All the Fun)"](/books/the-good-girls-guide-to-great-sex) by Sheila Wray Gregoire.

I'd put this in a similar, non-strenuous, at times goofy reading genre as ["Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps"](/books/why-men-dont-listen-and-women-cant-read-maps/). If you can squint past the sometimes frustrating parts, this book probably has some though provoking perspectives that you could benefit from meditating on.

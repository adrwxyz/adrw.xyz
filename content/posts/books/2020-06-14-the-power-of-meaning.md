**2017 | Emily Esfahani Smith**

Recommended by Suzie who thoroughly enjoyed it as part of her book club, and next recommendeed by my in-laws Hiba and Calin, I decided to give it a read for myself!

## The Key Question

Writer, historian, and philosopher Will Durant in the Great Depression was approached by a man who asked him why he shouldn't commit suicide. After reflecting, Durant pointed him towards finding meaning.

The key question everyone must have an answer to in order to live the author, via Albert Camus posits, is not "Does God exist?" but instead "Does life have meaning?"

After reflecting on the responses of writers, philosophers, religious texts, and traditions of the past, the author categorizes people's source of meaning into 4 pillars.

## Belonging

## Purpose

## Storytelling

## Transcendence

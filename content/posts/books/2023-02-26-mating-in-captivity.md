**2006 | Esther Perel**

Brought to prominence through a top TED talk on the topic that my wife recommended, I waited too many years to dive in to her podcast and her book.

Esther sets out a refreshing perspective which has been lacking in most other sex and relationship books I've read before, specifically she brings a less Western / North American that contrasts the more puritanical, religious, or efficiency minded approaches presented elsewhere.

Scheduling and technique fixes are not enough. Desire must be solved and cultivated.

Notably, she outlines that erotic deisre requires distance, mystery, otherness from our partner, and thus over time as partners become more intimate and build daily life together, that sense of otherness often diminishes, and desire likewise.

Carving out deliberate spaces to foster otherness, preserve self-identity, and even mentally think of our partner less one-flesh and more like someone separate, can help to foster the intrigue and passion that is more often associated with the initial honeymoon period of dating or the attraction of an affair.

Esther also contrasts the more puritanical (sex is dirty, bad) sexual culture that remains in North America against the more wholistic view found in Europe. For example, she describes the college drunk sexual hookup scene in these terms that people feel sex is so dirty that they only do it when they are sufficiently inebriated as to not associate what they are doing in that state with who they see themselves as sober.

Even in the statistics, this bears out. Teenagers on average have their first sexual experience 2 years later in Europe, and there are 8x more teen pregnancies in the United States. A culture that fundamentally sees sex as dirty relegates it to the shadows where nothing good results. In Europe where sex is more talked about and accepted as part of life, there is less of a culture of shame or guilt (which can have devestating and surprising second-order effects for couples).

Esther also touches on the counterintuitive point that the erotic lustful desire for a partner in some ways is selfish, and that can be part of the attraction to our partner. To constantly be seeking their approval on every move is exhausting and lacks the passionate pursuit of fulfilling pleasure for ourselves and our partner. Esther dr

In another section, she discusses how the implicit assumption of monogamy in most marriages and lack of acknowledgement or accpetance of the looming "third" to the couple's two, can sap desire. Desire as mimetic can increase when you realize that your spouse is attractive and if they wanted to leave, they could, and flee to the arms of someone else. That certainly can be motivation to improve but also to see our partner as attractive, desirable, and lust worthy. Assuming 'til death due us part' can easily backslide into a state of complacency where our own and our partner's needs are not taken seriously or addressed under the assumption that even if they are unsatisfied, they will never leave to seek better.

Esther's years of therapy with a diverse set of couples and academic studies and papers lead the book to be very to the point and practical with real life examples to illustrate her points drawn from the academmic literature.

Compared to every other sex and relationship book or therapy I've been through, this book is head and shoulders above them all at providing tactics to address to the deep hole in North American culture around fostering exotic desire within relationships and having a healthy acceptance of our own sexuality.

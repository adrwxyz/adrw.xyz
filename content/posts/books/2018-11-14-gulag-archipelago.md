**1973 | Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn**

Including over 200 stories from other prisoners during his own over 20 year stay in the Russian Gulag prison system, the author pulls back the curtain on what life was really like in Russia from the Revolution in 1917 through to the mass Gulag imprisonments of the 1940s and 1950s.

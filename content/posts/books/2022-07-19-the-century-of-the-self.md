How did the theories of Sigmund Freud impact marketing, propaganda, press relations, and the mass manipulation of population?

This documentary traces these ideas from their initial application by Freud's nephew Edward Bernays in the 1920s in the first corporate mass manipulative marketing schemes to their use in steering public opinion of foreign wars and coups in the 1950s and their eventual transition through the 1970s to rebrand corporate products as expressions of the self and appeal to former hippies and finally the rise of individualist political campaigns and polling focus groups which transformed politics from the 1980s to 2000.

Covering almost 80 years of history but as seen through the unique lens of manipulation of the masses for consumerist or elitist ends, I walked away with a better appreciation for the anarchist conclusion of Michael Malice, HL Menken, and others that the correct mental model of the average person is not that of a rational independent thinker but of a conformist non-introspective follower.

My more recent gradual acceptance of this view of most people as non-playing characters has been freeing from constantly being drawn into trying to persuade people I meet of the "correct" political opinions; or further to worrying about politics at all, given that most voters are irrational and manipulated to vote for the candidate preferable to elites.

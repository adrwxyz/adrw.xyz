**2018 | Matthew McConaughey**

Matthew McConaughey has made the rounds on numerous podcasts and shows pitching his book and I finally decided to give it a read.

It is thoroughly entertaining to read, a mix of his poetic "bumperstickers" and personal stories to draw out an approach to life that has helped him turn more red and yellow lights he encounters into Greenlights.

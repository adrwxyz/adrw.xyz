**1864 | Fyodor Dostoevsky**

Notes from the Underground came to my attention from MartyrMade's thought provoking podcast on the parallels between Friedrich Nietzsche's life and Dostoevsky's classic.

The book preports to publish found notes from a man who lived life the past 40 years "underground", self-cast out from society, festering and deepening in his pathologies of resentment, offense-taking, blaming others, arrogance, perceived superiority, and growing Messiah complex.

The book is split into two parts. The first, a diatribe monologue written as if to an audience of "gentlemen" on the true philosophy of the Underground Man. The second, as if providing an example, is a selective narrative of a time in the man's life – likely late 20s – and his interactions with other people.

The book served as a ringing conviction on my self-admitted partial tendencies from past and present and a byword against letting them fester a moment longer. It also served to further my understanding of others I'm frustrated by who clearly have allowed to fester to some extent aspects of the Underground Man's above described traits – specifically resentment, arrogance, and a Messiah complex.

**2016 | Antonio Garcia Martinez**

Brutally honest opening of the kimono for what life is like from Goldman Sachs to Silicon Valley to Y Combinator.

> There’s a Jewish folktale about a biblical king who dispatches one of his wise men to craft him a mantra that would both humble the proud and console the unfortunate. After searching in the market, where our wise man consults a local jeweler, he returns to the king with an engraved ring. The king holds the ring close and reads: THIS TOO SHALL PASS. So remember that, when lamenting your troubles, contemplating the perceived triumphs of peers and competitors, or rejoicing in that rare entrepreneurial triumph. It will all soon pass, and much faster than you think.

### What’s it take to do startups?

> It certainly isn’t intelligence.

> I was in the lower third of my PhD class in physics at Berkeley, and I had to take my preliminary exams three times before I passed. Most of the founders I know are certainly crafty and quick-witted, but compared with some of the certified geniuses I met in academia, they aren’t going to win any Fields Medals or Nobels.

> It certainly isn’t technical skill. I’m a crappy programmer, and I can hack crude prototypes of finished products at best. Some founders are technical virtuosos, but I suspect most weren’t the top students in their respective computer science classes (assuming they even had a formal education).

> It’s not unique product or market vision. Anyone who used Google’s ads-buying tool for all of five minutes, and then registered that that piece of shit was a $70 billion per year moneymaker, could see the need for AdGrok. Some startup ideas were visionary, like Airbnb, but many, like Dropbox, were merely extremely well executed versions of existing technologies.

> In my limited experience, there are two traits that distinguish successful startup founders at whatever level of the game, from the forgettably minuscule (e.g., AdGrok) to the epoch changing (e.g., SpaceX).

> First, the ability to monomaniacally and obsessively focus on one thing and one thing only, at the expense of everything else in life. I lived, breathed, and shat AdGrok. Thanks to focusing on AdGrok, I watched my daughter grow up through the frame of a Skype window while I was in AdGrok’s Mountain View shit hole. I had no social life outside of schmooze-and-booze tech events, at which I would wear my AdGrok T-shirt and engage in techno small talk with people I didn’t really care about. I had no hobbies or outside activities of any kind, except very occasional trips to the gym. My sailboat, into which I had poured two years of money and weekends to restore, slowly rotted in the sun. I never read anything except the tech press. Movies were out of the question. The ladies? While I was nominally still in a relationship with British Trader, my penis was anatomically equivalent to my coccyx: a purposeless vestige of a bygone era.

> Second, the ability to take and endure endless amounts of shit. I was raised under the sadistic care of a sister ten years my senior who delighted in unleashing endless taunts and abuses. My father was a domineering man, in every way. I spent years in an all-boys Catholic school filled with brutish bullies and cold, aloof priests. We did nothing but beat each other up and jerk off. I scraped by on nothing for six years as a penniless grad student in an expensive city, and then survived three years on Wall Street’s most competitive trading floor during its biggest market catastrophe. Long story short: within the limited purview of white-collar travails, there’s nothing I can’t take for an extended period of time.

> You might be asking why I’m being such a buzzkill. There must be some fun in startups, right?

> Sure, there are times when an entrepreneur’s life will make you feel like you’ve got the world by the tail. You just talked the biggest check you’ve ever seen out of a respected investor, and boom! there the amount appears, as big as life, in your previously barren bank account. You launch a product or write some blog post that goes viral, and for one shining moment, you’re the talk of the tech world. But those moments are far outnumbered by the countless moments of gnawing doubt, nauseating anxiety, and endless toil. If you’ve got a great relationship with your cofounders, then that camaraderie can maintain you. In fact, as in sports or war, the overpowering desire to not let down your fellows is often all that keeps you going. But if you have no cofounders, or if that band-of-brothers relationship isn’t there, then the only thing keeping the whole construct going is sheer, stubborn bloody-mindedness. You get up every morning, get kicked in the face, and come back for more the next day.

> Unlike maniacal focus, though, which is a personality trait too difficult to mold once in adulthood, this thing—call it grit, perseverance, or whatever—is something that can be learned. If you feel you don’t possess that strength within you, then go ride a bicycle across the United States, sail a boat across an ocean, or join the Marines. Whatever it takes to build those reserves of mental endurance. Or just jump into the fray, and you might surprise yourself.

> Incidentally, it helps to have enemies. While love is a beautiful emotion, far more empires have been built, books written, wrongs righted, fights won, and ambitions realized out of vengeful desire to prove some critic wrong, or existential dread of some perceived enemy, than all the love in the world. Love is grand, but hate and fear last longer.

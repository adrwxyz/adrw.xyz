**Daryl Cooper**

Another scorcher of a podcast series from Cooper, this one in 20+ hours covers the Jim Jones & People's Temple culminating in the infamous 1978 "revolutionary suicide" where almost 1000 people of the movement commited suicide in the jungles of Guyana with cyanide-laced Kool-Aid.

Though the series did go in-depth into Jim Jones and the movement, it probably spent equal amounts of time covering the much broader arch of the civil rights and revolutionary movements from the 1950s-1970s which were the setting for The People's Temple, many of the joining members, and countless celebrities and politicians in the midst of the wild age who had endorced and allied with Jones for years.

In contrast to Cooper's [Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem](books/fear-and-loathing-in-the-new-jerusalem) series, God's Socialist in many ways felt heavier and darker given the subject matter of the cult and quite possibly demonic forces which illuminated and infiltrated the age of the 1960s and 1970s.

In some ways, the podcast did provide a sense of solace while witnessing the increasingly unhinged culture in which we now find ourselves where revolutionary rhetoric, pseudo communist "woke" theology, and countless dedicated followers have imposed change by force upon university, medical, political, and financial institutions.

Where the late 1960s and early 1970s, rocked by riots and bombings, soon encountered a reactionary resistance from the majority of people interested in a quiet life and not the complete destruction of the existing culture; one hopes that the current "woke" and WEF pushed tides will similarly reach a reactionary force which pushes it back out to sea.

**2016 | Tim Keller**

Tim Keller sets out to write the book he wish he had when trying to learn to prayer, echoing the cry from author Flannery O'Connor, "Canâ€™t Anyone Teach Me to Pray?"

Updated with examples and descriptions for a modern audience while building on the legacy of teaching on prayer from historical authors on prayer, Keller explains that many pit two types of prayer against each other: communion vs. kingdom.

Commonion prayer focuses on meeting with God, communing with Him, experiencing Him.

Kingdom prayer focuses on a petitionary, longing, and crying out to God that His kingdom would be built, with less of an expectation of an experience of God or of His reply.

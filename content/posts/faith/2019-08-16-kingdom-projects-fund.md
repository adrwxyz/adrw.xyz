Serving Christ involves all our soul, heart, mind; our skills, talents, riches, time; everything we have.

His Kingdom is being built, and we can be part of the building team.

Suzie and I are figuring out how that looks like with respect to being portfolio managers for our own Kingdom Projects Fund.

## History

Even before we got married, Suzie and I had been talking about what this might look like. When we got married in July 2018, we started setting aside into a dedicated savings account a percentage of income every month to go towards kingdom projects.

## Motivation

Within the analogy of us being portfolio manager for funding the Lord's Kingdom projects, the question of return is a striking one.

For example, a portfolio manager is judged by the return, not simply that we put money towards any charity but that it is effectively and efficiently being used by the Holy Spirit to build the Kingdom. Jesus' Parable of the Talents speaks similarly to this principle that it is by the effort towards a return, the fruit, that we will be judged.

> 14 “For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants[a] and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents,[b] to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.[c] You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ – Matthew 25:14-30 (ESV)

And similar to an investments portfolio manager, the manager is not the one who is also running the corporations listed on exchanges that the manager has invested in. There is a separation too with kingdom projects in that it ultimately is the Holy Spirit who will bear fruit. No perfect picking of kingdom projects or intimate involvement and dedication will be able to produce lasting fruit when the Spirit is not present. So, while we do strive to do research and build relationships with mission partners to feel confident of how the funds are being used, we do also leave the ultimate fruit to the Holy Spirit to produce.

All of this to say, our motivation to grow the Kingdom isn't satisfied by throwing money at whoever comes and asks. We want to be led by the Spirit to fund projects big and small, organizations or individuals, who are using the resources wisely, effectively, and in line with the Spirit's movements in their mission field.

The books and resources at the bottom of this post have also been instrumental in opening our heart to how we can partner with God in the work he is doing around the world.

## What to fund?

This is a big question. A portfolio manager is judged by what they invest in that determines the fund returns.

For our Kingdom Projects Fund, the concept of Return on Investment (ROI) looks something like, how does every dollar we invest in a project contribute to the Kingdom being built?

- Does it appear that the Holy Spirit is at work in this mission?
- Is there a higher ROI with projects in different countries?
- Do certain projects that require more capital return enough to justify the high cost?
- Are the organizations stewarding resources wisely? Expense ratios?
- Is the project contributing to cycles of dependency? Is it part of the problem of Toxic Charity?
- Is the project helping bring people to know Christ?

## Current Projects

## Annual Accountability

Annually, we are making an effort to collect annual reports, financial statements, Excel spreadsheets of distributions, anything that our mission partners and organizations have that can help better inform us as to where the money is going.

Many times, mission partners will have monthly or quarterly update letters with specific stories from the field which also are encouraging to hear. For partners who live near by, we try to connect for a coffee to get to hear some stories first hand and understand what their personal and mission needs are in the current season.

We pray for guidance and that our heart would be drawn towards the missions that God would like us to fund, or to fund more. We also recognize in humility that sometimes we don't fund the right projects or with new information, feel a need to reconsider and reduce funding to be able to pour into projects that we feel more directly called to support.

The resources we've been given to steward by God are limited and so we do have to make hard allocation decisions. We do so with the faith that God whether through our resources or others', God will always find a way to provide for the projects that He is working through.

  - Imagine you're from Australia and came on a long trip to the US for 6 months. You can only take the money you wire back to Australia with you when you return. You can't bring any checked luggage, any shipping containers, any US Dollars back with you. Would you focus all of your wealth you make in the US on outfitting your hotel room with the most coordinated interior design, buying a condo, or focusing all your time on your material comforts? Of course not, you would cover your basics at a simple hotel, your meals, and send the rest back to Australia where it would count long term. Our relationship to money in this life in comparison to contributing to God's kingdom should be the same. We should cover our minimum and send the rest to heaven where our returns will be multiplied when we go to our true home at the end of this life. – summarized story from David Platt

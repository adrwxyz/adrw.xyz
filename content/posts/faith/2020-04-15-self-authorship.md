## Self Authoring

I purchased Jordan Peterson's Self Authoring program almost 3 years ago and never make it past the first screen.

I am routinely unable to finish what I start, but given the [rave reviews and results from other people who have done the program](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives), I want to give it another shot.

Get the program for yourself at [selfauthoring.com](https://www.selfauthoring.com/).

## Understand Myself

3 years ago I did complete the Understand Myself Big-5 personality assesment and it has continued to be a report that I come back to in trying to understand myself, my reactions, my tendancies, and other aspects of myself that seem different when compared with others.

Try the assesement for yourself at [understandmyself.com](https://www.understandmyself.com/).

Alternatively, the [Big Five Personality Test from Open-Source Psychometrics Project](<https://openpsychometrics.org/>) is free and the results were very similar to the Understand Myself assessment.

Motivated by my recent reading of Alee Denham's touring bike blog [CyclingAbout](https://www.cyclingabout.com/), his YouTube videos and helpful ebooks, I was curious whether the high upfront cost in equipment for bike touring would be worth it compared to renting it at the touring destination.

For example, in Taiwan and Europe, there is broad infrastructure of bike rentals and repair shops which would allow you to skip the hassle of packing up a bike and avoid the liability of your own personal bike being stolen abroad. Outside of some developed countries with expansive bike infrastructure, most countries and touring destinations would not be able to support the renting option.

For the comparison below, I primarily am interested in the case where buy or rent would be valid options so I researched costs for both paths for Taiwan and Germany.

### Rent

- Taiwan: $182 CAD / 10 days
- Germany: $400 CAD / 10 days

### Buy

- Bike: $2300
- Pedals and shoes: $300
- Bags & accessories: $400
- Total: $3000
- Airplane per leg cost: $50-100

### Breakeven

- Taiwan: 5-10 months touring
- Germany: 3-4 months touring

## Example Scenarios

### Both Buy

- Buy: $6,000
- Airplane per leg cost: $50-100
- Total (2 Asia, 2 Germany trips = 40 days): $6,800
- Total (10 Asia, 10 Germany trips = 200 days): $10,000

### One Buy, One Rent

- Buy: $3,000
- Airplane per leg cost: $50-100
- Rental fee: $182-450 / 10 days
- Total (2 Asia, 2 Germany trips = 40 days): $4,664
- Total (10 Asia, 10 Germany trips = 200 days): $11,320

### Both Rent

- Rental fee: $182-450 / 10 days
- Total (2 Asia, 2 Germany trips = 40 days): $2,528
- Total (10 Asia, 10 Germany trips = 200 days): $12,640

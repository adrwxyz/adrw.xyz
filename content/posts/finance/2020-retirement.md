# Wild Ideas

- If you have 4 kids and as a family make less than $31,711, you can receive $22,800 - $27,060 annually from the Canada Child Benefit (and an additional $1500/year from Ontario Child Benefit).
- What if you "retired" and voluntarily made less than \$31,711 to maximize government benefits while still having a paid off house and stock portfolio growing while not having those assets impact your income (and thus disqualify you from the benefits)

Taxation doesn't favour a family where there is a significant disparity in spousal income. Playing within the rules to minimize taxes in such a scenario is highly advantageous but can be challenging.

### Smith Maneuver Example

This example serves to illustrate the way that a readvanceable mortgage + HELOC, Smith Maneuver and knowledge of the taxation on capital gains from joint accounts, and the spousal attribution rule can be combined to provide a form of income splitting across two earning partners in a family with a large income disparity.

Consider the case of a family where the husband works a high paying job, the wife has retired from the workforce to start a small business and raise their children. On a salary taxable income basis, there is a vast disparity. Due to spousal attribution rules, any profitable sales from their joint margin investments account end up being attributed mostly to the husband, increasing his already high taxable income and putting their hard earned investment capital gains on the tax man's chopping block.

Suppose, they also have a house with readvanceable, 20% principal prepayment-per-year-allowed mortgage + HELOC and a corresponding margin investment account in the wife's name that they use to perform the Smith Maneuver.

In any given year, the husband can take surplus cash throughout the year and, instead of putting it into their regular joint margin account, use it to prepay down principal on their mortgage. Then, the wife can withdraw using the expanded credit limit room on the HELOC and invest in her margin account. The gains on sale of her investments are taxed at a much lower tax rate than if those gains had been attributed to her husband. Plus, those gains are further reduced since the interest she pays on the HELOC is tax deductible because she uses the loan for investments. Since the house is a joint asset but the margin account is strictly the wife's, this pattern provides a path for asset transfer from the husband to wife without the limits of the traditional joint account tax attribution which sets taxation based on funds contributed and would thus lead to any gains being counted against the husband assuming most of the funding of the margin account was from him.

Over time, the wife can sell investments and be taxed minimally on capital gains or hold income bearing investments and similarly be taxed minimally on earned dividends or interest; all of such income which would otherwise have been attributed to the husband and taxed at his top marginal tax bracket (which could be over 50% depending on the province).

Now, consider the case of the first year where the wife has just retired and that they already had an existing joint margin investment account that had a large amount of investments with unrealized gains. The margin account unless a reasonable explanation and tracing of money can be provided otherwise, will default to the contribution rule where the tax burden of gains is split based on the contribution into the account or by the ratio between the joint account holders' incomes if the contribution can not be determined. Consider the case where the husband in all the prior years used his income to cover all household expenses and let his wife contribute 100% of her after tax income into the joint margin account. There then is a large amount of the margin account gains that could be attributed strictly to her based on that contribution path. To segregate any future gains under her lower taxed income, she can sell the amount of joint margin funds that resulted from her 100% post-tax income contribution from the previous years, pay down the mortgage principle, draw on HELOC, and then re-invest in her sole margin account to remove any ambiguity around who is taxed for investment gains on those funds. The husband can slowly each year sell a portion of the funds and follow the similar path to space out the gains that would be higher taxed across a few years while still gradually moving them all to his wife's HELOC funded margin account.

# General

- City: Psreferred Kitchener because of looser bylaws, fire pits, easier building permits. Waterloo is fine too.
- Neighbourhood: Walking appeal, non-sketchy, kid-friendly, not near high rise / community housing, no street noise, low traffic, walking to grocery store
  _ Mary Allen
  _ Union/Belmont
  _ Moore/Cemetary
  _ Union/Park/Glasgow/Belmont beneath GRH
  _ Albert/King/Central/Bridgeport historic block
  _ Lincoln Heights near 227 Carter
- Rooms: 3+ bedroom (or room for addition)
- Rental / Mortgage Helper: No, don't want to be a landlord. Rental units also generally worse condition than owner occupied.
- Age: Prefer built before 1964 for more traditional, easily maintainable building techniques
- Lot: some backyard (100-130ft+ lot depth esp if addition needed), not corner lot
- Good structure: Poured concrete or block foundation, minimal renovations done
  _ Acceptable problems: UFFI, asbestos insulation
  _ Unacceptable problems: active knob and tube, water damage, weak foundation, smoke damages
- Finishing: Minimal renovations done, don't want to pay for someone else's hack jobs
- Proximity to Family: <10 mins drive to family, ideally <40 mins transit to UW
- Budget: <800k

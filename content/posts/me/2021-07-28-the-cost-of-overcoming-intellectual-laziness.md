Daniel Kahneman outlines in "Thinking, Fast and Slow" the mental model we should have of thinking having two systems. System 1 is fast and by heuristics. System 2 is slow and from first principles.

By default, we always revert to System 1 if we have any heuristic that can apply to a given situation. It is faster and still transfers us from the sensation of unknown to that of feeling that we understand a given situation or stimuli.

System 1 allows us to live everyday life and it comes for free. Without it, we would have to from first principles evaluate the risk factors involved with driving every time we get behind the wheel. We would need to evaluate the trajectory and gravitational physics that would let us model and predict whether a baseball thrown will land in our glove as we have it currently positioned.

Thus, it isn't that System 1 is bad, but that it can be the hammer in search for a nail.

In countless examples in "Thinking, Fast and Slow", System 1 can be easily fooled by novel stimuli, biases, exceptions to heuristics or other factors. The lack of engaging System 2 for these problems leads to faiure.

And so it is not with any condemnation that I bring the cost intellectual laziness, as given the context above, the use of System 1 is by definition the more efficient, or lazy, path that we inherently rely on to live life.

In evaluating what some would term conspiracy theories, a lack of complete knowledge or ability to empirically verify a claim can make belief or disbelief a faster conclusion to land on with System 1 guiding the plane to the ground.

Depending on your current heuristics of how society works, whether those in power can be trusted, or the possibility of non-formally planned conspiracies to none the less play out at such based on misaligned incentives in all the right places, a conspiracy theory can sound plausible or implausible regardless of the truth of the claim.

For example, ...9/11, iraq/afghanistan war, vietnam bay of X war, NSA/snowden, JFK, pfizer/j&j fines for opioids baby powder etc...

Given the above informs a heuristic of skepticism towards institutional narrative that discourage analysis from questions around conflicts of interest, profit motive, or power grabs which could be more fitting explanations than the narrative.

With that heuristic, a proposed analysis of lockdown and masking policy to fight COVID-19 could include raising to light the nature of this policy resulting in the massive transfer of wealth from small businesses (family restaurants, shops) to big businesses (Amazon, Costco, chain restaurants), that masking promotes reduction of trust among people and a snitching culture â€“ thus further fragmenting the any possible oppostition to ruling powers, and drastic long term limitations placed on previously universally (in Western countries) expected rights of freedom of assembly, religion, and speech now resulting in a more easily controlled citizenry by governments who otherwise would have had a hard time justifying scaling back all of these freedoms.

The default narrative that lockdowns and masking is solely for public health reasons seems to fall apart on analysis that lockdowns and mask mandates anywhere implemented have had no correlation to case or hospitalization rates. Furthermore, the recommended medical and cloth masks are insufficient to stop the small aerosolized SARS-COV-2 particles; they are not N95s and serve only to reduce larger bacteria or fluids transfer (hence their traditional use in medical or surgical settings).

On analysis of vaccines, the heuristic of skepticism of the interests of drug companies, their influence on regulators, and the fever pitched influence efforts in media and via vaccine passports to coerce uninformed submission to briskly emergency authorized vaccines. Yet while all those can be true and concerning, it is a separate question of whether concerns of the vaccine efficacy and safety are well founded. If the vaccine is effective and safe, then despite all the surrounding corruption and counter-productive propaganda and restrictions, it could be worth taking it.

On efficacy, many propagandistic claims routinely oversold vaccines as being effective at eliminating transmission, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In practice, vaccines appear to be primarily effective at reducing deaths with some reduction to symptoms and hospitalization rates, and further no (and in some cases potentially negative) reduction to cases or transmission. Continued data from Israel, UK, and Iceland all show increasing case numbers but reduced hospitalizations and deaths in contrast to previous COVID waves. The efficacy could very well ware off over time or against new variants, as would be expected with such a gene therapy, but complete failure to reduce death and hospitalizations remains to be seen.

On safety, the perceived willfull blindness of regulators and media to concerns of side effects, long term feasibility of repeated boosters, insufficiently long trials, raises doubts. Yet, given the extremely high number of doses administered, and even taking into account under-reporting bias, there don't seem to be immediately identifiable high probability severe side effects.

As similarly non-causal as many reported COVID deaths are since people die and some die with a positive COVID test but from other conditions like gunshot wounds or cancer, deaths reported after vaccine can be from any number of non-vaccine factors. VAERS allows reading individual reports, Health Canada and other reporting agencies do not. A clear understanding of causality would require these tends and hundreds of thousands of cases to be investigated and analyzed. Were there a serious side effect that was wide spread, at this point it is hard to believe that it would not have emerged and been reported on organically even if there was suppression and averted eyes at regulators and drug companies. It already happened for 2 of the 4 approved Western vaccines, Johnson & Johnson and Astra-Zeneca vaccines both being paused or rollouts cancelled in various jurisdictions following more frequent reports of blood clots and other conditions.

Given the seeming efficacy at reducing hospitalizations and deaths, and no obvious, predominant side effects to halt rollout, the vaccines themselves, though launched with great fervour and lubrication of regulatory standards, may very well not be "the story" when the final analysis of COVID management and malfeasance is written.

Coming to the following conclusions was not easy when, for many months, my analysis was intellectually lazy, and relying on System 1 to synthesize scientific summaries from podcasts and Twitter, agree heuristically with the broad claims of shady dealings in government and pharma industry, and then base my actions on those conslusions and proceed with resisting the social and media pressure to conform to the latest behavioural demands: getting the jab.

The cost of intellectual laziness was increasing conflict and alienation from family, friends, colleagues, and my wife. Though open to conversation, all except those with my wife and in-laws quickly descended into being on the listening end of appeals to emotion, authority, scoffing, and accusations; none of which were effective at accomplishing the basic step of convincing me to engage System 2 to validate the bedrock claims being spouted on podcasts and Twitter.

Fundamentally, the breaking point for me was when my wife encouraged me to dive into the research papers and try to verify the claims I had taken on from podcasts and Twitter, like for example, the spike protein in the vaccine was the same as in wild SARS-COV-2 and thus cytotoxic and the cause of side effects.

It turns out, according to the papers I found in Nature, the spike protein in the vaccine is identical to that in SARS-COV-2 except for a slight mutation induced that is supposed to stop the protein from cleaving and binding to your cells, which is how many symptoms of COVID-19 are caused. That cuts starkly against the concerns raised by the most credible of the people I was following, Dr. Robert Malone who did some of the initial research on mRNA vaccine technology in the 1980s, and claimed in podcasts and on Twitter that the spike protein in vaccines was the same and equivalently toxic as that in wild SARS-COV-2. As of writing, he has not replied to my question to clarify his remarks via LinkedIn.

Thus, assuming a low trust relationship with media and drug companies, I'm left with having to rely on the leap of faith that 1) what's in the vial is what is expected, 2) that the research papers are honest in their analysis of the vaccine's spike protein, 3) that some serious delayed, long term side effect isn't embedded in the vaccine, and 4) that though the drug companies have been fined for their numerous dishonest antics in other drugs, the COVID vaccines are in the bucket of ones that are reasonably safe and effective despite their immoral producers.

Though I still can't rule out the possibility the vaccine is toxic long term, there's no long term data to to assess, the short term data doesn't raise significant red flags, the efficacy in reduced death and hospitalization in the short term at least seems consistent across countries, and frankly the coerced benefits of being vaccinated with regards to travel and social dynamics are enticing.

I still strongly disagree with much of the public health policy and social coercion that has become standard world wide since COVID-19 started spreading. That only 3 people in my life were willing to hear me out, and one (my wife) take the time and effort to encourage and evaluate claims from first principles to see if they held water, is disheartening. Other than one grandparent who consistently reached out to try and discuss benefits of the vaccine with me, all other family and friends shunned me as a leper.

At one a few years into starting to invest in stocks, my portfolio had grown from $25k to $1.5m from aggressive saving and riding the rocket ship of one holding which at one point was 92% of my portfolio. When that holding proceeded to crash 92%, my portfolio value was erased down to $300k but my initial mindset of $1.5m of unrealized paper wealth had lingered on like a bad hangover.

When the portfolio was near peak, it was exciting, and yet disconcerting and uncomfortable to think that my wealth was quite possibly 10x or 100x friends or family members who were older and had worked longer and harder than I had. Perhaps, in some way, that contributed to my unwillingness to consider taking profits thinking that I should stay for the full ride. I at that time thought I had won the lottery and thought to steward it well and be generous with causes and family. That mindset of generosity also came with it an implicit mindset of knowing, even just to myself, that I was richer than them and could afford to easily pick up dinner or drinks or even consider giving them a downpayment for their house.

The self-rightousness and way of carrying myself lasted well over a year after the stock had cratered and I'd have had no way to backup my generous intuitions or offers. Soon after the words tumbled out of my mouth, I would have a sinking feeling realizing that,no, in fact, that cheque I had metaphorically just written would bounce. I had no way to actually finance that given my much more humble portfolio size.

I was under illusions as the stock went up that a large amount of luck combined with prudent savings could be enough to become wealthy and not have to worry about money any more. I just had to 10x my money a few times and I'd be there.

I'm now left with the prospect that instead of a large nest egg to self-insure against illness, injury, or job loss, I'm much more within band of friends and family I thought I had financially left behind.

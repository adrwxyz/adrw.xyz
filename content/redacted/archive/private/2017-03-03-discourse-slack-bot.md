**As we worked on a custom [Discourse forum](https://www.discourse.org/) for internal use, it was determined that Atomic needed a Slack bot.**

With a Slack bot, colleagues across the company could quickly search for resources, information, and people on the internal Atomic forum.

I was tasked with installing the Slack bot plugin into Discourse but realized that there was no `/discourse search` style functionality.

Forking the open source plugin, I added search functionality using Ruby-on-Rails.

Though the Atomic project ended up pivoting away from Discourse to a custom built ReactJS/Node.js solution, Atomic encouraged me to open source the improvements I made with a [pull request into the original Discourse-Slack-Official repo](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-slack-official/pull/19).

  - Machine Learning Perceptron to predict Calgary Fire Dept response times
---

**2 weeks into CS489 Machine Learning, I applied what I learned to Calgary Fire Department open data.**

I was excited to take what I was learning in my CS489 Machine Learning course at University of Waterloo and apply it to a new data set.

When I walked by the [Canada's Open Data Exchange (CODX)](https://codx.ca/) booth at Hack the North, I realized what a perfect opportunity I had found.

Searching through the countless data sets, I found an interesting one from the City of Calgary Fire Department that contained response times by different scenario categories.

Writing this weeks after the hacking was finished, I realize that a naive perceptron algorithm was not the best algorithm to use for this type of regression problem. I've also since learned the importance of regularization and massaging the data so a model can be trained effectively on it.

All of that being said, the naive perceptron still predicted at 95% accuracy after 500 iterations on the data set below.

Another great Hack the North, 4th year in a row!

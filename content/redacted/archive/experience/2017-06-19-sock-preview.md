Suzie and I (that's us up there!) have been working the past few months on a new brand that **solves problems we have when buying socks!**

**_...but we need your help!_**

What problems do you have while shopping? What brand story resonates with you?

Weâ€™d really appreciate your feedback! The form below takes <2 minutes, try it! ðŸ˜…

PLUS we'll give you **early access & 30% off your first order** when we launch later this summer...And send a **free pair of socks** to one of you!

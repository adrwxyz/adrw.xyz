Continued data from Israel, UK, and Iceland all show increasing case numbers but reduced hospitalizations and deaths in contrast to previous COVID waves.

That cuts starkly against the concerns raised by the most credible of the people I was following, Dr. Robert Malone who did some of the initial research on mRNA vaccine technology in the 1980s, and claimed in podcasts and on Twitter that the spike protein in vaccines was the same and equivalently toxic as that in wild SARS-COV-2.

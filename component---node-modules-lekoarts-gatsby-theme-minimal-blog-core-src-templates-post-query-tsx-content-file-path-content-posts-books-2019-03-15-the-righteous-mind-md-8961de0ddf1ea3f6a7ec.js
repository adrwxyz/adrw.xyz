But if you think about moral reasoning as a skill we humans evolved to further our social agendas—to justify our own actions and to defend the teams we belong to—then things will make a lot more sense.

But people have so many other powerful moral intuitions, such as those related to liberty, loyalty, authority, and sanctity.
